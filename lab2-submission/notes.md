Lab2 based on Lab1:

Learned how to define modular Hono routes (e.g., expenses.ts) and hook them into the main app.

Practiced building real API endpoints (GET, POST) for an Expense Tracker.

Implemented a custom middleware for logging requests and responses.

Explored Zod with @hono/zod-validator to validate request body data and return structured errors.

Struggled a bit with TypeScript types when wiring Zod schemas to Hono, but gained clarity after debugging.
